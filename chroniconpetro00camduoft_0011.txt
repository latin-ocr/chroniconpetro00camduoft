The Chronicle which is now printed for the first time, from a
contemporary manuscript belonging to the Society of Antiquaries of
London‚ was compiled by some unknown monk in the ancient abbey
of Peterborough3 that venerable establishment by which English

other things», for a most valuable text of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle‚³
for the chronicle of abbot Benedict, published by Hearne‚b and for
that of Hugo Candjdus, or Hugh White, and his continuatorS, pub-
lished by Sparke.0 In the present work we see a new claim upon
our gratitude to Peterborough. Commencing in the year 1122, it
consists for the first hundred years of brief entries principally relating
to public affairs. During the next fifty years it becomes a little
more minute, and more specifically a Peterborough chronicle‚ but it
is not until after 1273 (p. 20), the year of the death of Robert de

which it derives its chief importance.

Robert de Sutton expired on his journey from or towards—for the

one of its most celebrated altars. He left the affairs of his beloved
abbey in miserable confusion. During the six centuries which had
