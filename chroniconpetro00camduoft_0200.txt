in this manuscript, with a reference to its owner, Alfnoth or Alnod. Between him and
Aschil the manor of Scitter was in equal moieties‚ both as to demesne and socage.

The next entries in this manuscript relate to the wapentake of Manley in the same divi-
sion, and in the catalogue we have: “ The Abbot of Bure has in Aukborough one carucate,
and in Walcote six carucates and six bovates, and in Messingham four carucates and six
bovates and a half, and in Holm three carucates, and in Raventhorp one carucate and six
bovates, and in Manton two carucates, and in Hibaldstow one carucate and two bovates,
and in Risby three bovates, and in N ormanby ..... and in Ashby three bovates and a half,
which . . . . . and Nigel hold.'’ It is evident that the property of this abbey had
increased since these two surveys in this wapentake, for we have here seven and a
half carucates in Walecote, and another half soke of the manor of West Halton
belong to Earl Hugh of Chester. In Domesday the sole entry as to Appleby and
Risby and Sawcliff gives three bovates as its contingent ; but here we have a whole
carucate in Appleby‚ of which the Queen had the soke‚ and another in Risby in demesne
of the land of Fin. The lands in Broughton and Scawby are also additions, as well
as the lands in Bottesford and Froddingham ; and elsewhere there is an increase in the
number of bovates. As to the lands in the wapentake of Lawress‚in the same division, the ca-
talogue has this statement: “ The abbot of Burc has in Scotherne and Sudbrook four caru-
cates and four bovates,and in Fiskerton three carucates, and in Reepham four carucates and
six bovates.'' In Domesday the soke of this manor of Fiskerton, in Scothorne, and Holme,
and Sudbrook, is stated to be five carucates of land and one half. In this manuscript only
five carucates are mentioned, omitting the half carucate. In the Testa de Nevill for the
county of Lincoln these earlier entries of the reign of King John occur; thus in the
wapentake of Aveland “ Abbas de Burgo habet tres partes feodi unius militis in
Walecot, quas Robertus de Hascebi tenet de eo. In the wapentake of N eSS, “Abbas
de Burgo habet in villa de Turleby servicium unius militis et dimidii, et Brianus
de la Mara tenet. Abbas de Burgo habet in Estdeping et in Stoue et in Berham
servicium tercie partis feodi unius militis, quod Baldewinus Wacke tenet in domi-
nico.'' In the wapentake of Beltisloe, ‘⁶ Abbas de Burgo tenet in Karleby et Bihael
feoda .ii. militum, que Baldewinus Wacke tenet. Abbas de Burgo tenet in Osgotebi
feoda .ii. militum, .i. quarterio minus, quod Willelmus de Sancto Medardo et Alicia mater

feodum unius militis. Robertus de Nevilla tenet illud de eo. Idem abbas tenet in
Malmetun duas partes tercie partis unius militis. Robertus de N evilla tenet illud de eo.
