xiv INTRODUCTION.

some astonishment. (ibid.) It is full of curious and profitable in-
fcrmation. We cannot enumerate all the litigations in which the
abbot was involved (a list of them will be found in the Index under
the head of Peterborough), and will mention only one more. The
abbot established his exclusive right to hunt within his own domains,
and obtained a judgment by default against John Caurymaury and
several other persons who were in the habit of running with their

p. 26, and the account of the translation of the body of St. Hugh at
p. 40. The translation was a very great occasion. Edward Ι. was

that very occasion. (ibid.)

original manuscript, for which every facility was given by the
Society of Antiquaries. The transcript from which it was printed
