is this eutry:—“ Soke. In Walcote four carucates of land, subJect to Dauegeld. Laud
to five ploughs. There twenty-two sokemen and four boors, and half a church and
twenty-six acres of meadow.” Walcot is a parish in the wapentake of Aveland‚
parts of Kesteven‚ one mile and a half from Folkingham, and adjacent to Threck-
ingham. The church, dedicated to St. Nicholas, had not been appropriated to the
Priory of Sempringham in 1251, according to the taxation of Pope Nicholas. P. 61.

Gand gave these tythes to the abbey of Bardney3 but probably it was the Abbey of
Peterborough which eventually ceded its rights 1ο this advowson. At the Dissolu-
tion the rectory was valued ‚at 1211. 193. 5d.; the curacy at 3li. Thurlby‚ a pa-
rish in the wapentake of Ness, parts of Kesteven, contains the hamlets of Obthorpe
aud Northorp, and the church, dedicated to St. Firmin, was appropriated to the
nunnery of St. Michael, in stamford-Baron, com. North¹¹; and at the Dissolution the
rectory was valued at 181i. 48. The distinction between Turufesbi and Torolbi in this
manuscript is explained by two entries in Domesday. The manor of Turolvebi, of three
carucates and five bovates, is said to have been held as Walcot 3 but the manor of Turolvebi,
of one carucate and a half, is described as having been the land of Elnod, and free-soke
under Aslac, and as held under the abbot by Godfrey. Hence the description ‘⁴ de terra
hominum suorum.'' The single carucate in demesne iu the parish of Uffington must have
been acquired since the Domesday survey, as the only entries respectiug property of the
abbey in it are the following :—“ Iu Uffington St. Peter of Burg has forty-eight acres of
meadow, free from Danegeld. These holds Godfrey, aud the villains of the abbot. In the
time of King Edward they were worth 20 shillings3 now likewise.'' Under “land of
the Countess J udith '⁹ we read, “ in Uffington Leuric Abbot of St. Peter of Burg
had sixty acres free from Danegeld. J udith the countess has this land. She has no cattle
upon it3 but she cultivates it as parcel of the manor of Belmesthorp.” Under “ claims in
Chetsteven‚” “ the wapentake (of Ness) says that sixty acres of land, which the Countess
J udith has, and cultivates with the ploughs of Belmesthorp‚ St. Peter of Burg had in the
time of King Edward. of these sixty acres of land and of the forty-eight acres of meadow,
the wardenship (warnode) lies in Uffington‚ the mauor of Alured of Liucoln ; but it is with-
