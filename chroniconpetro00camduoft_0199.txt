aud correspoud with this entry in Domesday, under ‘⁶ land of Godefrey de Cambrai:”·—
“ In the same (East Deeping) St. Peter de Burg had five sokemen upon five mauors of
two carucates of laud and six bovates subJect 10 Danegeld. Laud to 88 many ploughs
and oxeu. There two vassals of Godefrey have one plough and a half, and twelve villains
with three ploughs aud a half, and oue fishery of 1212. aud sixty acres of meadow. In the
time of King Edward 11 was worth 603. now 503. Tallage 12ss Under land of St. Peter
of Burg, after the survey of the mauor iu Witham and Manthorpe aud Toftlound, is this
entry, “Berewick of this mauor in Barholme and Stowe 0116 681116816 of laud subject
to Danegeld. Laud to oue plough. There Asford has two villaius aud two boors
with one plough. Iu the same, one carucate of laud subject 1ο Danegeld. Laud to one
plough. The soke in Burg. Now Godefrey, the vassal of the abbot, has nine sokemeu,
and oue villain, and two boors, with two ploughs. Robert holds oue half. Iu the time
of King Edward it was worth twenty shilliugs, now twenty likewise. In stowe 80116
111 Witham, four bovates of laud aud a half subject to Danegeld. Laud to as many oxen.
There Asford has of the abbot oue villain and two sokemen with half a plough. In the
same place, two bovates of laud subject to Danegeld. Laud to two oxen. The soke is
attached to the fabric of St. Peter of Burg. There Godefrey has of the abbot one villain
an'd two sokemeu with half a plough. In the time of King Edward it was worth three
shillings, now likewise.'' This reductiou is thus explained among the claims in the west
riding of Lindsey : ‘⁶ In the hundred of Torp in the time of King Edward Siward Rufus had
oue carucata of laud with 886 and soke ; aud little while since Ralph de Neville had held
it of Abbot Turold ς but he had not 11161601· from him livery of seizin. Now it is deraigned
10 1116 1186 of the King.'' The two next 61111168 relate to six bovates 111 Torp, and to three
carucates and a half iu Scotton. In Domesday‚ 86011011 18 put down at six carucates‚
with oue carucate iu Torp, soke of this manor. Iu the claims of Kesteven is this entry z
“ The Abbot of Burg claims 0116 bovate of land against Drogo in the hundred of Witham.
The wapentake says that it ought to be the laud of St. Peter, and the soke of Gislebert de
Gaud iu Edeuham. In Bytham hundred Ratbodus ought to have 0116 carucate of laud,
which he claims 3 but the soke is of St. Peter of Burg.” Northorpe is a parish in the wapen-
take of Corringham, as also 18 86011011, which adj oius it 3 Scotter is a parish iu the same, and
Oleatham is a township in the parish of Mantou iu the same. Scotterthorp aud Yawthorp
are places in the same. Iu the catalogue of tenants holding lands in the several wapen-
181168 of Lindsey, of the eighth year of the reign of King Henry the First, ΑΛ). 1108, is
this statement 88 10 11181 of Corringham, in the west riding ε “ Τ116 Abbot of Bure has in
Scottou six cmcates, and in Scotter eight carucates, and in Seotterthorp three carucatas,
and in Yawthorp (overliued Herbert) four bovates, aud iu Torp (overliued Herbert) four
bovates, aud in Torp (overliued R(adulfus) de villa one carucate, and in Cleatham oue
carucate. Herbertn' The right reading is Nevilla, 88 111 Domesday, where Lolestorp
occurs for Yawthorp. Thus the manor of Cleatham is rightly fixed at seven bovates, as
