summoned the parties before his commissary-general in St. Mary-le-
Bow. The intention of the abbot seems to have been to weary out
the claimant with long-continued litigation. Papal provisions were
most unpopular, and were no doubt often contested merely with the
view of putting the claimant to expense, and driving him to
relinquish his provision.

The suits by the abbot himself are of many kinds, One is
against a refractory tenant of the abbey by knight-service‚ who
refused to pay his quota of a relies. On another occasion the
tenants of the abb'ey declined to perform their service except at

tithe of all venison killed within the royal forests of Northamptonshire
(pp. 34, 36, 37, 39, 54); and also his exemption fi‘om contributing
any share of the charges of repairing the wall of Northampton
park (pp. 52-54). He put down the hand-mills used by the
people of Oundle, to the injury, it may be presumed, of his wind-mill,

presentation of the church of Pokebroke (p. 77), and his very iln-
portant right to the chattels of felons and fugitives within certain
hundreds (p. 119). An instructive account of the sums received
under this last head will be read with interest, and probably with
