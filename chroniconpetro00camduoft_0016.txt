which was thus afforded to the house enabled him to return with credit.
Once at Peterborough, he set to work with vigour. If we may judge

from the book before us, he searched into the old charter-chests‚
brought forth the evidences of ancient rights, claimed dues and duties
which had fallen into abeyance during the presidency of his too-easy
predecessorS‚ and mansully asserted to the very letter all the rights
of the abbey, as well against the crown as against private persons,
The ultimate result cannot be gathered from the present· chronicle.
All that appears here is, that the abbot’s legal knowledge and the
eloquent pleading of William de Woodford generally enabled the
brethren to triumph, but that they were involved in enormous litiga-

instance before the bishop of Lincoln. ‚After long inquiry the bishop
decided in favour of the claimant. The abbot appealed to the arch-
bishop of Canterbury, who quashed the bishop's adjudication, and
