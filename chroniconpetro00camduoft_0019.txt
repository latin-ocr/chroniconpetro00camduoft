INTRODUOTION. XV

was made for the late Commissioners on the Public RecordS, and
was lent to the Camden Society by direction of the Right Honour-
able Sir George Grey, Bartâ€ž the Secretary of State for the Home
Department, on the recommendation of the Right Honourable
the Lord Langdale, Keeper of the Public RecordS. The publication
was suggested to the Camden Society by Sir Francis Palgrave,
the Deputy Keeper of the Public RecordS.

It only remains to beg of the Society to excuse the imperfections
of these remarkS, and of the Index appended to the Chronicle. I
am aware how very much better Mr. Stapleton would have displayed
the merits and the contents of his work. In his absence, which no
one regrets more than myself, I have done what I could to testify
my respect for himself, and my willingness to do anything in my
power for the service of the Camden Society.
