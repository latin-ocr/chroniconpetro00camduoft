drawn by force.'' “ The land of the Oountess J udith ‚'' in Northantonscire, contains these
entrioe concerning Rutland, as well as in Lincolnshire. “ The Countess J udith holds of the
king one hide and a half in Riehale. There island to eight ploughs with the appendages.
In demesne is one, and four bondmen and ten villains, and four sokemen have four ploughs.
There two mills of 36⁸. Forest 4 quarantenes long and two quarentenes broad. Belmestorp
belongs to this manor. There one hide and a half, and in demesne two ploughs, and
fourteen villains, and six boors have four ploughs. There a mill of 10⁸. Sd. and sixteen
acres of meadow. The whole was and is worth six pounds.” Ryall, a parish in the hundred
of East, county of Rutland‚ containing, with the hamlet of Belmesthorp‚ 439 inhabitants-
Under “Land of Alvred of Lincoln Manor,'' “In the same vill (Uffington) Leduinus
had one carucate of land, subJeet to Danegeld. Land to one plough. There Alured
has four sokemen of four bovates of this land, and three villains with one plough,
and nine burgesses of Stamford rendering four shillings, and twenty acres of meadow.
In the time of King Edward, and now, it was and is worth 30⁸.” This is doubtless the
manor which came to the abbey of Peterborough. In Domesday there are separate entries
as to lands in Witham—on-the·hill, a parish in the wapentake of Beltisloe, parts of
Kaeteven, containing the hamlets of Manthorpe and Toft-with-Lound: first, after
Adewelle “in Witham and Manthorpe‚ and Toftlound is a berewick of half a carucate,
which Ansfrid holds ;'' second, “ a manor in the same places where Hereward had
twelve bovates of land subject to Danegeld. Land to one plough and a half.
There Asuert‚ the vassel of abbot Turold, has six villains and four boors, and two
sokemen with two ploughs, and twenty acres of meadow, and forty acres of wood.'’
The parish of West or Castle Bytham in the same wapentake, comprisae the chapelry
of Holywell with Awnby‚ the township of Castle Bytham, and the hamlet of Coun-
thorpe. The manor of Bytham, of four carucates, in this manuscript is evidently
identical with this entry in Domesday: “ Berewick of Bergestorp is in Bytham, of four
carucates of land, subJect to Danegeld. This land is the demesne of St. Peter of Burgh.”
Doubtless this berewick was the now hamlet of Aunby. The next entry in this manuscript
is “ Breides'torp‚ containing five carucatoe ;'’ and evidently identical with this entry in
Domesday, “In Adewell St. Peter of Burg had and has five carucates of land, subject to
Danegeld.” The only mention of Bredestorp in Domesday is under the “land of Drogo
de Bevrere‚'' where it is overlined “hundred.'' Manor. In Bredestorp‚ Earl Morcar
had seven carucatas of land subJect to Danegeld. Soke in West Bitham. The same
tenant held West Bitham, Little Bitham, and Counthorp. Hence Holywell and
Awnby were the lands of the* abbey, for the number of carucates correspond.
Tho next enti-y “Ansgotesbi of five carucates‚” is identical with the “ Osgotebi
of Domesday‚'' also, of five carucates, which refers to the township of Osgodby,
in the parish of Lavington, wapentake of Beltisloe, parts of Kesteven. The
two next entries refer to the pai-ish of East Deeping, in the wapentake of N ess,
